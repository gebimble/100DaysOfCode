# 100DaysOfCode

## Day 1

Created the 'typer' - a function that mimics the way someone might type
something into a command line.

TODO : (maybe) alter this so that it occasionally puts in mistakes, and those
goes back and deletes them. I don't even know if you can remove things that
have been printed to std.out, but I'm gonna find out!
